%Note: when working with functions for homeworks: please put the functions
%as separate files in the repository. Use the main homework file to call
%the functions and demonstrate that they work. Make sure the functions are
%appropriately commented (so that "help {function name}" produces
%something useful. 

% 1. Write a function that takes an array as input and returns a logical
% variable which is true if the sum of the numbers in the array is greater
% than or equal to 10 and false if it is less than 10. 

%2. Write a function to take the reverse complement of a DNA sequence, that
%is, returns the complementary base pair for each base, read from end
%to beginning. (e.g. the reverse compliment of ATGC is GCAT). Do not use the
%builtin MATLAB function for this. 

%3. The fibonacci sequence is defined such that each number in the sequence
%after the first two is the sum of the previous 2. For example:
% 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21....
% (a) Write a function that takes two inputs - an array containing two integers
% which will be the first two values of a fibonacci sequence and an integer
% N which is the number of values desired and returns a fibonacci sequences
% of length N with the specified first two numbers. (b) Write a function which 
% takes a fibonacci sequence as input and produces the next number of that
% sequence as output. (c)Write a function with same input-output
% relationship as in (a) but that uses your function from (b) to do the
% computation.
